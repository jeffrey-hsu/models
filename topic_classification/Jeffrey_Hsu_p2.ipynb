    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "If the prediction and the correct label matches, the R value should be 1 since it's taking the ratio of max probability and correct label probability.

The last one was predicted as religion whilst the correct label is atheism. The first 2 documents were likely predicted as computer related topics since the texts contains words such as Microsoft, ASCII and so on, whilst they are actual talking about religion resources online. \n",

    "The model is making this mistake most likely because it was giving certain key words a very high weight, thus as long as they occur, the prediction is biased towards those specific labels no matter what the other contect or relationship between words look like. One way that may fix it is by extracting n gram words, thus considers relationship or ordering between sequence of words.
